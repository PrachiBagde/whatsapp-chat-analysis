# whatsapp-chat-analysis
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and evaluate WhatsApp chat data to extract meaningful insights, trends, and patterns from conversations. The project leverages data analytic techniques to process chat logs, enabling users to understand communication behavior and metrics such as user activity, word usage, and sentiment trends.
I have also used stremlit in pycham to create a localhost web page to get a good visual representation of my project.
you can upload chat txt file here - http://localhost:8501/ to get detailed insight of your data.
